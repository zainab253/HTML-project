   <h2>backend<i>[server-side]</i></h2>
   <p>Server-side scripting, or backend development,<br> is all about what goes on behind the scenes.
    The backend is essentially the part of a website <br>that the user doesnâ€™t actually see. It is responsible for<br> storing and organizing data, and ensuring that everything <br>on the frontend runs smoothly. It does this by <br>communicating with the frontend.</p>
    <h3>Frontend<i>[client-side]</i> </h3>
 <p>Client-side scripting, or frontend development, <br>refers to everything that the end user experiences directly.<br>
  Frontend code executes in a web browser and directly relates <br>to what people see when they visit a website. Things like layout, fonts, colours, <br>menus and contact forms are all driven by the frontend.</p>
